### What Needs Work üöß

1. **UI Implementation**
   - Most pages need to be built out
   - Forms need to be created
   - Data tables need implementation
   - CRUD operations UI missing

2. **Testing**
   - No tests written yet
   - Testing infrastructure needs setup

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Security hardening needed
   - Performance optimization needed
   - Monitoring setup required

4. **Features**
   - Advanced features not implemented
   - Email notifications missing
   - Real-time updates not implemented

## Quick Start Guide

### For Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wemersonnino/FullStack.git
cd FullStack

# Start services
./start.sh
# or
docker-compose up -d

# Access:
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:1337/admin
```

### For Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Technical Debt

Current technical debt items to address:

1. **Tests**: No test coverage yet
2. **Error Handling**: Needs improvement throughout
3. **Loading States**: Not implemented in UI
4. **Form Validation**: Zod schemas defined but not used
5. **API Client**: No centralized API client
6. **Type Definitions**: Shared types need to be defined
7. **Documentation**: API examples could be expanded

## Performance Metrics

### Current Build Times
- **Frontend**: ~5 seconds (production build)
- **Backend**: ~30 seconds (initial build)

### Bundle Sizes
- **Frontend**: ~114 KB (First Load JS)
- **Backend**: Standard Strapi build

### Optimization Opportunities
- Frontend code splitting
- Image optimization
- API response caching
- Database query optimization
- Docker layer caching

## Known Issues

None currently. This is a fresh implementation.
